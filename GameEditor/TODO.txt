- tile editor/sprite editor: pick color with CTRL+mouse

- map editor: pick tile with CTRL+mouse

- import/export map:
  - export map (from map editor)
  - import map (from tileset list editor: "Import Maps On This Tileset...")
    -> file must contain only map data ("game_map_tiles_XXX[]" and "game_maps[]")
	-> all imported maps will reference the tileset they were imported on

- project lint (check errors, like too many tiles in tileset)

- make editor for map connections (world editor)
